This project uses the iMCU W7100 capabilities to connect an PIDE Hard Drive to a 100MB/s LAN. 

The project is intended to be a low-cost solution, only using the core W7100 circuitry and two level-shifting TTL latches 
to implement the design.  The lightweight ATA-Over-Ethernet (ATAOE) protocol is used to move the data over the LAN at 
high speed with the minimum of software overheads
